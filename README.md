## Getting Started
#### Get your own API key from:
 * [open weathe map](https://openweathermap.org/api)
 * [aqicn](https://aqicn.org/api/)
 * [Google Cloud Platform](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

##### Setup for google Cloud API key:
  * Go to Google Developers Console.<br/>
  * Create a New Project.<br/>
  * From Left Menu, go to Credentials section; click on Create Credentials and generate API KEY.<br/>
  * Copy API KEY of the project.<br/>
  * Again From Left Menu, go to Library section; search Places API and enable it.<br/>

  Once you have created the keys,
  Put in the right place
  
  in file **services/wather.dart** in the top put the open weathe map key and aqicn.<br/>
  in file **screens/location_screen.dart** put the google api key (search ``` 'Your_api_key' ```).<br/>
  <br/>
    **You can change the language and places in the search:**<br/>
         &nbsp;```language: "en",```<br/>
         &nbsp;```components: [Component(Component.country, "il")]); ```
        <br/>
        <br/>

**This is my first app , Apparently some things can be done better.**<br/>
